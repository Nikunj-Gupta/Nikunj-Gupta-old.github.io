<p>Hello! My name is <a href="nikunj-gupta.github.io"><strong>Nikunj Gupta</strong></a> and I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/"><strong><span style="color:orange">IIIT Bangalore</span></strong></a>, India, completing my Bachelor’s and Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering in 2019. I am currently collaborating with <a href="https://drmatttaylor.net/"><strong>Prof. Matthew E. Taylor</strong></a>, affiliated with the <a href="https://ualberta.ca/"><strong><span style="color:orange">University of Alberta</span></strong></a>, <a href="http://rlai.ualberta.ca/"><strong><span style="color:orange">RLAI</span></strong></a> and <a href="https://amii.ca/"><strong><span style="color:orange">Amii</span></strong></a>, developing new methods to <em>learn to communicate through interaction</em> in fully cooperative multi-agent settings, to improve local coordination and learning. My interests broadly lie in the fields of <strong><span style="color:green">multi-agent reinforcement learning</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:green">human-in-the-loop AI</span></strong>.</p>

<p>As part of my Master’s thesis, I worked with <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/g-srinivasaraghavan"><strong>Prof. G. Srinivasaraghavan</strong></a> (<a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/"><strong><span style="color:orange">IIIT Bangalore</span></strong></a>) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/swarup-mohalik-9845181/?originalSubdomain=in"><strong>Dr. Swarup Kumar Mohalik</strong></a> (<a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en"><strong><span style="color:orange">Ericsson Research</span></strong></a>) to build a framework for fully cooperative MARL in a <em>centralized learning with decentralized execution</em> setting. During my stay at IIIT Bangalore, I have also spent a lot of time working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tVEF11EAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"><strong>Prof. Dinesh Babu Jayagopi</strong></a> to develop <em>Deep Convolutional GAN</em> formulations for generating reasonably realistic images. During Summer 2017, I was fortunate to work with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyasheel-sharma-2438361/?originalSubdomain=in"><strong>Dr. Divyasheel Sharma</strong></a> at <a href="https://global.abb/group/en/technology/corporate-research-centers/india"><strong><span style="color:orange">ABB Research Center</span></strong></a>, on <em>Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Better Feedback</em>.</p>

<p>I have been also employed as a <span style="color:orange"><strong>Data Scientist</strong></span> at an AI startup — <a href="https://aganitha.ai/"><strong>Aganitha Cognitive Solutions</strong></a>, supplementing best coding practices to my skills and familiarizing myself with concepts like <em>Learning-to-Rank algorithms</em> and <em>Graph Convolutional Networks</em> for medicinal chemistry.</p>

<p>Apart from work, I enjoy playing Badminton or passing my time watching some Sci-Fi thriller or a RomCom drama TV Show. :blush: I enjoy reading non-fiction books too! I have also been following the very recent and really cool <a href="https://shows.acast.com/the-robot-brains"><strong><span style="color:orange">Robot Brains Podcast Series With Pieter Abbeel</span></strong></a>. Do check the episodes out!</p>
