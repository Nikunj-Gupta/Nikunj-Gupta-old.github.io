I"©	<p>Aganitha Knowledge Machine (AKM) is a perpetual knowledge machine, with ocassional human assistance. The aim of this tool is to pipeline cognitive (AI/ML) components for the purpose of continuous knowledge construction from both structured and unstructured information sources. The content can vary from being static (reference information) to changing periodically (like news or periodic reports).</p>

<p>We built Neo4j property graphs to extract added value of information with great performance and in an agile, flexible and scalable way. Graph databases such as Neo4j perform better than relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Very simply, a graph database is a database designed to treat the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself. It is intended to hold data without constricting it to a pre-defined model. Instead, the data is stored like we first draw it out - showing how each individual entity connects with or is related to others.</p>

<h2 id="why-graph-databases">Why Graph Databases?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We live in a connected world! There are no isolated pieces of information, but rich, connected domains all around us. Only a database that natively embraces relationships is able to store, process, and query connections efficiently. While other databases compute relationships at query time through expensive JOIN operations, a graph database stores connections alongside the data in the model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accessing nodes and relationships in a native graph database is an efficient, constant-time operation and allows you to quickly traverse millions of connections per second per core.</p>

<p>Independent of the total size of your dataset, graph databases excel at managing highly-connected data and complex queries. With only a pattern and a set of starting points, graph databases explore the neighboring data around those initial starting pointsâ€‰â€”â€‰collecting and aggregating information from millions of nodes and relationshipsâ€‰â€”â€‰and leaving any data outside the search perimeter untouched.</p>
