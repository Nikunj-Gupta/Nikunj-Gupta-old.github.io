<p>Land Use Land Change (LULC) analysis is one of the primary applications ad- dressed using geo-spatial data analysis. A broad range of problems fall under this category. Some examples include flood monitoring, landslide monitoring, urban growth patterns, change in vegetation patterns and forest cover analysis. In this report, we describe methods for analyzing the impact of flood on an urban area using remote sensing data. High and medium resolution radar data are made available by sources such as the Sentinel-1 satellite mission. Radar data is useful for flood monitoring since the radar signals (microwaves) can penetrate through clouds and hence provide a clear view of the scene, unlike optical images where the view is obstructed by cloud cover. India being predominantly a tropical wet/humid region experience 3-4 months of monsoon (from July-September) in most parts. The southern regions of India (parts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh) witness heavy rainfalls in the post monsoon period (October-November). Given the vast extent of the country and the long duration of monsoon, floods are a frequent occurrence in the coun- try. For efficient disaster management, it is essential to have methods in place to assess the damage caused by floods. In this report, we analyze the damages and impacts of one such flood event which occurred in Chennai in the year 2015 using remote sensing data. For our analysis, we use the radar data from Sentinel-1 satellite mission. We perform image pre-processing such as multi-looking, calibration and geo-referencing (ter- rain correction) followed by feature extraction and classification using machine learning. The rest of this report discusses our methods in detail.</p>
