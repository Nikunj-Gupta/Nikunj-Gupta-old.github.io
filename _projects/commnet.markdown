title: Multi-Agent RL Frameworks in PyTorch  
description: Forked this cool repository that implements CommNet, BiCnet and MADDPG --- some of the state-of-art multi-agent RL frameworks. I am building upon it to incorporate some of the new ideas that I have in mind. I would also upgrade the repository to support PettingZoo Multi-Agent environments.
