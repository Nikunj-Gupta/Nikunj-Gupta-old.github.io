**<span style="color:#0080ff;font-size:15px">"How can interaction lead to better behavior, better perception, better models of the world? What are the computational issues in doing this efficiently and in realtime? These are the sort of questions that I ask in trying to understand what it means to be intelligent, to predict and influence the world, to learn, perceive, act, and think."</span>** --- <span style="color:green;font-size:15px">Prof. Richard Sutton, University of Alberta</span> 

Hello! My name is [**Nikunj Gupta**](nikunj-gupta.github.io) and I graduated from [**<span style="color:orange">IIIT Bangalore</span>**](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), India, completing my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science and Engineering in 2019. I am currently collaborating with [**Prof. Matthew E. Taylor**](https://drmatttaylor.net/), affiliated with the [**<span style="color:orange">University of Alberta</span>**](https://ualberta.ca/), [**<span style="color:orange">RLAI</span>**](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/) and [**<span style="color:orange">Amii</span>**](https://amii.ca/), developing new methods to *learn to communicate through interaction* in fully cooperative multi-agent settings, to improve local coordination and learning. My interests broadly lie in the fields of **<span style="color:green">multi-agent reinforcement learning</span>** and **<span style="color:green">human-in-the-loop AI</span>**. 

As part of my Master's thesis, I worked with [**Prof. G. Srinivasaraghavan**](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/g-srinivasaraghavan) ([**<span style="color:orange">IIIT Bangalore</span>**](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/)) and [**Dr. Swarup Kumar Mohalik**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swarup-mohalik-9845181/?originalSubdomain=in) ([**<span style="color:orange">Ericsson Research</span>**](https://www.ericsson.com/en)) to build a framework for fully cooperative MARL in a *centralized learning with decentralized execution* setting. During my stay at IIIT Bangalore, I have also spent a lot of time working with [**Prof. Dinesh Babu Jayagopi**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tVEF11EAAAAJ&hl=en) to develop *Deep Convolutional GAN* formulations for generating reasonably realistic images. During Summer 2017, I was fortunate to work with [**Dr. Divyasheel Sharma**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyasheel-sharma-2438361/?originalSubdomain=in) at [**<span style="color:orange">ABB Research Center</span>**](https://global.abb/group/en/technology/corporate-research-centers/india), on *Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Better Feedback*. 

I have been also employed as a <span style="color:orange">**Data Scientist**</span> at an AI startup --- [**Aganitha Cognitive Solutions**](https://aganitha.ai/), supplementing best coding practices to my skills and familiarizing myself with concepts like *Learning-to-Rank algorithms* and *Graph Convolutional Networks* for medicinal chemistry. 

Apart from work, I enjoy playing Badminton or passing my time watching some Sci-Fi thriller or a RomCom drama TV Show. :blush: I enjoy reading non-fiction books too! I have also been following the very recent and really cool [**<span style="color:orange">Robot Brains Podcast Series With Pieter Abbeel</span>**](https://shows.acast.com/the-robot-brains). Do check the episodes out! 

**<span style="color:#0080ff;font-size:15px">"Distilling AI into an algorithmic construct may also help us better understand the human mind --- including profound mysteries like the nature of creativity, dreams and consciousness"</span>** --- <span style="color:green;font-size:15px">Demis Hassabis, DeepMind</span>
