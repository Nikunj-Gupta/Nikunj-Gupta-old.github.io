> <font size=4>"How can interaction lead to better behavior, better perception, better models of the world? What are the computational issues in doing this efficiently and in realtime? These are the sort of questions that I ask in trying to understand what it means to be intelligent, to predict and influence the world, to learn, perceive, act, and think."  --- <span style="color:green">Richard Sutton</span> </font>

Hello! My name is Nikunj Gupta and I graduated from [*IIIT Bangalore*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), India, completing my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science and Engineering in 2019. I am currently collaborating with [*Prof. Matthew E. Taylor*](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~taylorm/), affiliated with <span style="color:orange">*University of Alberta*</span>, to work on the *Teacher-Student framework* in reinforcement learning, where we are exploring methods to improve peer-to-peer teaching in cooperative settings. My interests broadly lie in the field of <span style="color:green">**multi-agent reinforcement learning**</span> (MARL) and <span style="color:green">**human-in-the-loop AI**</span>. 

As part of my Master's thesis, I worked with [*Prof. G. Srinivasaraghavan*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/g-srinivasaraghavan) and [*Dr. Swarup Kumar Mohalik*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swarup-mohalik-9845181/?originalSubdomain=in) (<span style="color:orange">*Ericsson Research Bangalore*</span>) to build a framework for fully cooperative MARL in a *centralized learning with decentralized execution* setting. During my stay at *IIIT Bangalore*, I have also spent a lot of time working with [*Prof. Dinesh Babu J.*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tVEF11EAAAAJ&hl=en) to develop *Deep Convolutional GAN* formulations for generating reasonable flower images. During Summer 2017, I was fortunate to work with [*Dr. Divyasheel Sharma*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyasheel-sharma-2438361/?originalSubdomain=in) at <span style="color:orange">*ABB Research Bangalore*</span>, on Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Better Feedback. 

Currently, I am also employed as a <span style="color:orange">*Data Scientist*</span> at an AI startup --- [*Aganitha Cognitive Solutions*](https://aganitha.ai/), supplementing best coding practices to my skills and familiarizing myself with concepts like *Learning-to-Rank algorithms* and *Graph Convolutional Networks* for medicinal chemistry. Further, I developed a *predictive maintenance* solution for mission-critical equipment using deep reinforcement learning methods.
